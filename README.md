# Todos-List
 A To-Do App built with React allows users to create, update, and delete tasks efficiently. It provides a simple, interactive interface where users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them once done. The app utilizes React's state management to keep track of tasks and updates the UI in real-time without page reloads.
